## Get configuration file

If you don't already have a project in Firebase you need to create one in order to generate credentials for an IOS and Android application


[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)

1) Add your IOS and Android App inside Project settings.

*Access project settings on top left pane next to Project Overview*

2) During the Add App process download the config file.



## WebClientId

webClientId will be automatically generated once you create the app in the firebase console.
You can access the `webClientId` [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Make sure you select the correct project. `webClientId` should be under OAuth section.
